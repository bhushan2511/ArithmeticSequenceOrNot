# ArithmeticSequenceOrNot
An unsorted array will be given, we should find whether the arrayis in arithmetic sequence or not. 
Approach:

Find the max and min element in the array, using find the AM. Whereas 

AM =(Max-min)/ (length of array -1);

then, 

Find whether the (each element - 1) is divisor of AM.
